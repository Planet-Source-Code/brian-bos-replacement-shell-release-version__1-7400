When BoS is installed, the taskbar, start menu, and desktop icons don't show up.
Here's how to install BoS:
- Compile the project into B.exe 
- Go to Start > Run
- Type in "C:\windows\system.ini" and press enter 
- Find the section that says "shell=explorer.exe".
- Change it to "shell=<< FULL Path to B.exe >>". 
- Reboot your computer 
If, for any reason, you make a spelling mistake and BoS doesn't come up, press Control-Escape - from there just follow instructions 2-6
 
Begone, desktop icons and start menu! Hello, BoS
